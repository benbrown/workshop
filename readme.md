# BOTS: A workshop
## DRAFT

## Using this project

This project contains sample code and instructions for a workshop about building bots with the Bot Builder SDK.
The workshop is broken up into a series of modules, each one with its own dedicated folder.

Within each module folder is a readme file with instructions, along with the code and other files necessary to operate the bot.
The code files are provided in a "before" state, ready to be modified according to the instructions given in each readme.
In many cases, the code changes required to reach the "after" state of each module is included inline, but commented out. 

Developers may choose to start from scratch, building all of their own files from scratch, _or_ they may navigate from folder to folder,
using the pre-built sample files.


## Get Started

Before the workshop, [take these steps to install required tools](code/01.setup/readme.md#install-important-bot-building-tools).

If you want to follow along using the pre-built code samples, you'll need to download a copy of this project.
